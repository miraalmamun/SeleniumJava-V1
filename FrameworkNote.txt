The WebDriver layer:
The WebDriver layer is ideally located in the src/main/java folder, which
is considered a good programming practice. To ensure its maintainability,
it's recommended to organize this layer into three distinct classes:
DriverFactory, DriverManager, and Driver. This modular approach promotes
better code management.

The DriverFactory class manages the configuration of various drivers such as
Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others.
The DriverManager class supervises driver instances using ThreadLocal.
ThreadLocal allows the creation of variables that are accessible exclusively
within the same thread, the safeguarding of parallel testing.

Lastly, the Driver class consists of two core methods: one for initializing
the browser and another for closing it. This separation of roles ensures a
clear and efficient handling of browser instances. By embracing these practices,
your WebDriver layer becomes well-organized and simpler to maintain, leading
to effective and robust test automation.
